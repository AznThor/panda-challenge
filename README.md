A few things that stand out from analyzing this data. Unsurprisingly, in terms of Gender Demographics, over 84% of players were Male. This may be due to the game being effectively advertised towards male players. Another unsurprising data point is that more than 75% of players were between ages 15-29. This shows that this is most likely the game's target market, and its extremely effective at selling to this age range. However, a surprising data point is that the average total purchase per gender was higher for Females. This may be because the females who do play this game have been already loyal customers.
